- Got used to working collaboratively in a group. Using git branches and making sure we got no merge conflicts.
- Worked really well together as team with Tommy

Struggles:
- Definitely struggled initially deploying our app to Heroku and making sure our front and back end were linked together. Also making our API requests using the Heroku link instead of our localhost link on the front end was a struggle to figure out. But in the end, we got everything linked and functioning how it's supposed to.
- Struggled getting the login functionality to work for a couple days, but I referenced the auth project files at the top of the project 3 markdown and was able to figure it out.
- Struggled with the filtering functionality for a few days. But finally we were able to figure it out and it was an amazing feeling! Super proud of us.
